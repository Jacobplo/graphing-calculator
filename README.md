A simple graphing calculator that can display multiple closed-form functions based on user input.
Values of the functions can be traced, or the point of intersection between multiple functions can
also be calculated.

Guide:
- The first button on the left allows the user to input a closed-form expression. Spaces must be
added between different operators, values, and functions. E.g. "( x + 5 ) ^ 2", "2 * sin ( x )".
Constants, operators and functions that can be used are: "pi", "e", "+", "-", "*", "/", "^", "sin", "cos", "tan", "abs",
"sqrt", "ln", "floor", "ceil" "(", ")".
- The most recently added function can be removed by pressing the delete button (second button the the left).
- All functions can be removed by pressing the trash can (third button on the left).
- Function coordinates can be traced by pressing the "(x, y)" button, and using the left and right arrow keys
to move along the function values. Different functions are cycled through with the up and down arrow keys.
- Function intersections can be found by pressing the "U" button. Arrow keys are used for function navigation,
and functions can be selected by pressing enter.
- Opened menus or the program can be closed with the "X" button.
- Use the config.properties file to change graphing calculator properties.
